Hey create a portfolio and give me every file needed,Here are the essential sections your portfolio website should include, keeping the doodled, cartoon-style, 3D animated theme in mind:

1. Hero Section (Landing Page)
	•	Animated Intro: A playful animation like a hand drawing the website elements or paper crumpling into shape.
	•	Your Name & Tagline: Large, vibrant, animated text with wobbling or bouncing effects.
	•	A Doodle Avatar: A cartoon-styled self-portrait (can be interactive, e.g., blinking, changing expressions on hover).
	•	CTA Button: “Let’s Connect” or “See My Work” with a bouncy animation effect.

2. About Me Section
	•	Short bio with a fun twist (e.g., text appearing like it’s being typed).
	•	Doodle timeline of your journey (animated hand-drawn progress line).
	•	Hidden One Piece Easter Egg: Clicking a certain part triggers a random One Piece quote or Luffy’s laugh.

3. Skills Section
	•	Doodle-styled Skill Icons (hover effect makes them wobble or jump).
	•	Live animated progress bars or floating 3D elements to represent skill levels.
	•	Possible UI idea: “Wanted Posters” of your skills (e.g., “Expert in React - Bounty 1M XP”).

4. Portfolio (Projects) Section
	•	Grid or Card Layout for projects, each with a doodled hover effect.
	•	Animated previews: Small doodle sketches turning into actual project screenshots.
	•	3D Layering: Clicking a project makes it pop forward like a storybook animation.

5. Testimonials (If Needed)
	•	Speech bubble-style testimonials from clients, mentors, or peers.
	•	Doodle avatars instead of normal images.
	•	Jumping or wobbling effect on hover.

6. Contact Me Section
	•	Hand-drawn contact form (like filling out a paper form).
	•	Social media links appearing as cartoon stamps or stickers.
	•	Fun Animation: Clicking “Submit” crumples the form into a paper airplane and sends it flying.

7. Footer (Fun and Interactive)
	•	Live animated One Piece Easter Egg (e.g., Luffy’s straw hat floating around).
	•	Doodle navigation links.
	•	A small “Made with ❤️” note in a handwritten font.
